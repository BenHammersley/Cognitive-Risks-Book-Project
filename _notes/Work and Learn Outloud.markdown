One last piece we want to attach to this practice is the idea of transformation. We have noticed that even if we sit and share findings after a project or write them down in a document, often times that doesn’t actually transform the way we do things. We want to answer questions like; how can we focus on a few key learnings we truly want to activate? How do we go from transparency and observation to next steps, adaptation and transformation?

This is the text of a note. It can have links to the outside world with double square brackets link text colon url [[like this::https://www.benhammersley.com]], or to internal pages with just the double brackets.

It can have left hand side footnotes [Like this, which is just like linking to another thing, only using lsn as the URL::lsn]]. And the same works for the right hand side too [Like this, which is just like linking to another thing, only using rsn as the URL::rsn]]


You can also put links and html inside the notes. [[Like this. *Which is fun.* <br/>**See Below for more**.::rsn]] 

Links to Wikipedia and some other sites have a superscript added to it. [[preference falsification::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification]] has become a normative social element.

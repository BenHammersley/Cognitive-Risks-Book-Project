There are many types of knowledge, each with different properties, different social values, and different tools and experiences needed to master them. Following from the 1945 paper byÂ [[Gilbert Ryle::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Ryle]], [[Knowing How and Knowing That]], we can talk of these as:

- [[Know-How]] - [[Tacit Knowledge]]
- [[Know-That]] - [[Explicit Knowledge]]
- [[Know-Why]] - [[Science]]
- [[Know-Who]] - [[Networking]] 
- [[Know-To-Do]] - [[Ethics]]

A team with true [[Cognitive Diversity]] should contain them all, and have systems in place that encourage their intermixing. For example: [[Strategies For Tacit Knowledge Transfer]].

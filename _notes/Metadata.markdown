#Metadata

The data about the data. For example, a newspaper article consists of its body text, which is the data, but also a title, its publication date, the name of the author, the name of the publication, the subjects it covers, and so on. As machine-learning gets better at doing so, we can use AI to infer more types of metadata - the emotion register of a piece, the sentiment towards something, and so on. The more metadata we have, the more connections we can make between things.

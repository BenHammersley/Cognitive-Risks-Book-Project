<h2>Infrastructure Colophon</h2>
<p>This site, and the technologies behind the Hammersley Futures systems, have been extensively upgraded since March 2020. This site, and its contents, is created by a combination of human expertise and a suite of machine learning and agent-based subsystems that, for want of a better metaphor, tend to the gardening. More will be written about it in the future.</p>

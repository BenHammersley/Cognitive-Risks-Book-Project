excerpt: In which we lay out our stall

---

To be fair, you were asked to do the impossible. To operate, to lead, to manage, to grow, to thrive even, in a time of unparalleled change and technological development would be hard for anyone, even without your disadvantages. 

Especially the disadvantages that you don't know you have. Because that's what I'll be addressing in this site. The newly discovered, newly recognised, newly apparent, newly emerging ways in which the modern world prevents you from thinking clearly and creatively, from understanding what is truly happening, and from making the correct decisions about what to do next.

The past decade has not only seen an almost complete transformation in the world and how we live in it, but has also seen a transformation of our very understanding of the nature of how we observe and think about this world. 

But that understanding is not commonly held. The average person is being asked to deal with this ever-new life with knowledge and ways of thinking that they were given at school: tools that are now long obsolete. And while we might feel uneasy about own abilities to deal with whatever the next new thing is, as we struggle with the relentless changes of today, we're even more aware of the unsuitability of the tools that our leaders are bringing to the world. From our direct bosses, to the CEO, from your local government to the Head of State, we seem to be entrusting our future to people who are confused by the present.

As if this wasn't bad enough, the ability to think clearly about the world as it truly is such a valuable thing to have that it has become the main target for warfare and crime in the 21st century. At their heart, everything from cybercrime to cyberwarfare, online scammers to nation-state driven malware attacks, media manipulation to Deep Fakes, are all the same thing: to make it impossible for you to operate in the world as it actually is.

When the opening two decades of the 20th century added Air to Land and Sea to make the then three domains of warfare, it radically altered the geopolitics, and the fates, of the nations of the world. Adding Space, and then Cyber, in the closing decades, made the game harder and more expensive to play. But as I'll discuss, the 21st century has now added a sixth domain: Cognition. And this changes everything once again. Politicians and Generals, long used to planning to win the last war, may have already lost the next one.

As disturbing as that thought might be, a future war doesn't overshadow today's daily battles. And here it is now clear than many of us are actively hindered by our environment, handicapped by mental models of the world that are no longer true, held back by the way we collaborate and share our knowledge and ideas with others, and relegated by the tools we have to express the thoughts and ideas we actually do have.

Because while everything is changing, and while we cannot continue to work, learn, live, or think in the ways we learnt to in the past, and while our digital tools have doubled and doubled and doubled again, over and over, in their number and power, most of us have not. The future of human performance is already here, just not evenly distributed. Not just for individuals, but within our families, companies, communities and countries too.

For while the out of touch politician, or the executive struggling through a middle-age crisis, will be greatly helped by the learning in this book, we must also recognise that is also in our collective groups that we face the largest problems.

There is a growing cognitive gap, between those who are able through education and environment to prosper in the 21st century, and those for whom the complexity, novelty, and disruptive transformation of these years is doing nothing but leaving them behind.

And as you'll see, the fresher understandings of the world that are offered by modern tools and contemporary conceptions, are the basis of the missing key skills we need for living the rest of our lives. 

In the following months, I'll be exploring the four areas - inputs, mental models, environment, and [[Tools For Thinking]] and expression - that make up the ways we are being held back.  In each, I'll explore the causes of the cognitive risk, and talk with experts and researchers in the field about the things we can all do to mitigate or reverse the detrimental influences, and to harness and amplify the newly known techniques for maximising your potential in the world. Not just hacks to get the most out of your brain, but whole new ways of seeing the world, to understand what is truly going on, and to develop the meta-cognitive skills that can make even newer skills, in order to understand things that haven't even invented yet. Futureproofing yourself in way that makes your current unease go away forever. 

We'll be spending the rest of our lives living in the future. Best we go equipped.

## Introducing [[Zettelify::https://zettelify.benhammersley.com]].

The discussion of the [[Future of Work]] should really be separated into different categories. The [[Future of the Workplace]] is different from [[Future Nature of Employment]] or the [[Future Forms Of Business]]. Discussing the workplace means discussing the tools and systems that we use now and will in the future.

The very nature of being a [[Knowledge Worker::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker]], at the minimum, is to have a [[Cognitive Toolchain]] that we use to take in information, do something to it, and then send it on to someone else.

But that is not the only toolchain we need. For the Adaptive Futurist, a true [[Cognitive Toolchain]] creates a system that captures all the information, all of the both [[Tacit and Explicit Knowledge]] that the person possesses and also encounters, but then adds value to it. It's not just a notebook.

That value could be additional knowledge, an easier or more timely method of recall, or the exposure of the connections between ideas and systems that you weren't previously aware of. [[Indeed, that's what I'm trying to illustrate here with this not-a-book site::rsn]]

Making a system like this, however, requires the combination of both a technique and the tools to facilitate it. It's not just a software issue: it requires a set of habits and techniques.

For processing, capturing, and exploring new information, I've found that the [[Zettelkasten::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten]] system, when used with a networked-thought notebook [[Roam::http://www.roamresearch.com]], works very well. Articles, books, webpages, and so on, that I read, are summarized and stored in Roam in a format that helps build connections between pages.

But doing this usually requires writing out the [[Metadata]] of an article by hand, which can be tiresome.

To help with that, I built an app called [[Zettelify::https://zettelify.benhammersley.com]], that takes a URL and returns all of the metadata it can usefully find. The result right now is a block of text to cut and paste into Roam, in a format that makes sense for it. Try it out, even if you don't use Roam or the Zettelkasten system yet.

excerpt: Using VR for a wildly better workspace

I've wanted to be able to do this for a long time, and now we can. If you have an [[Oculus Quest::https://www.oculus.com/quest]], and install the [[Immersed app::https://immersedvr.com]] you can put your mac's displays into a VR world, and _then add more virtual monitors,_ and place them in space around you. This is slight bonkers. But not as bonkers as the fact that you can still use Zoom.

But then again, [[Immersed also lets you put yourself into a shared VR co-working space::https://blog.immersed.team/co-work-in-a-virtual-coffee-shop-with-real-people-f220cef3d9b9]]. So, you know, move that one from the future column over to the present day.

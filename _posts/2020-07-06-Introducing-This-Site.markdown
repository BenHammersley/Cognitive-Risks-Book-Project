Cognitive Risk and Adaptive Futurism are [[complicated and complex]] concepts to grasp in their entirety. They are [[Hyperobjects]] that encompasses everything from [[the effects of the air we breathe on our ability to think]] to [[the new structure of geopolitics]] to the nature of the basic tools we find on our desks. The aim of this site is to build up a massively interconnected compendium of the concepts and tools that we find the most useful, and to show the connections between then. The result will be a weird thing: not a book, with the typical linear structure, but more of a [[non-linear thinking]] Choose-Your-Own-Adventure with pages that will adapt and guide you personally. Over time it will become a different experience for different people, with your own personal journey through it guided by your own digital [[Virgil::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)]]. But all of that is to come.

To be clear, this is a work in progress, we are [[working in public]], and it is a project that is causing us to rebuild our entire toolchain and workflow. We're releasing some of those tools too! [[Introducing Zettelify]]

In the spirit of [[Constant Legacy Free Reinvention]] this has been a very good thing. [[You might notice that many words are highlighted in yellow or appear like they should be a link, but aren't clickable. Those signify pages that have yet to be created, transferred, or simply finished. They will be soon::rsn]]. Furthermore, some parts of the site are currently available only to certain clients. As those restrictions come to their natural contractual end, the links and pages and notes and apps will become visible here.

They say that a work of art is never finished, merely abandoned. There is a third option: that it becomes a tool in itself, and continues to evolve through use. As our own [[Cognitive Toolchain]] has adapted to this project, we've found that this particular substantiation of it, this Stock in a world of [[Stock and Flow]] produces its own [[Flow State]]. We don't know how it will develop, but in the spirit of [[Adaptive Futurism]] we know that the journey it creates will mean more interesting opportunities for us all, including you, dear reader, in the future. Thank you for being part of this journey, and do come back often to see the lands we are unveiling.
